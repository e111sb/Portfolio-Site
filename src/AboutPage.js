        <p className="aboutPageText">Hi, Iâ€™m Ellis Bowman an aspiring software developer from Essex. I am currently in Year 13 of Sixth Form working towards my A-Levels in Computer Science, Maths and Physics. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Throughout my life I have been interested in software and developing small projects spanning a variety of languages, libraries and devices. So far I have the most experience with Web Development using JavaScript and React while using databases such as MySql and MongoDB but I am very eager to explore new technologies and programming languages, especially embedded systems.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In the near future I hope to study for a degree while getting more practical knowledge and experience during a degree apprenticeship so that I can get a running start to my future career.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Thanks so much for taking the time to look at my portfolio website and read about me.</p>
