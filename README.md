# Portfolio-Site
A simple, static portfolio site created in React.
This site only uses libraries built in with React and as such it can be easily recreated by creating a new React app (https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and including this src folder instead of the automatically created one.
Please feel free to use this code and or design in any way you want on your own site.
